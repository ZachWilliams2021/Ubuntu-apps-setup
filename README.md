# Ubuntu-apps-setup
My first Linux script! This includes installation of debian and flatpak packages. The flatpak part was much more difficult for me because the remote user aspect doesn't seem to be documented well or at least it doesn't make sense in the aspect of not having to create a remote user when I installed Pop_OS! on hardware.
